# Improving-LM05-QKD-Protocol-by-introducing-decoy-state
LM05 Decoy-State QKD Simulation: This repository implements the LM05 two-way quantum key distribution protocol with decoy states. It simulates signal, weak decoy, and vacuum pulses, evaluates QBER, detection statistics, and Eve’s information, and demonstrates how decoy analysis detects photon-number-splitting and intercept–resend attacks.
